# cardSimulation

The website is now publicly available @ www.cardsimulation.com

The idea is to practice class naming following [Block Element Modifier rules](http://getbem.com), and practice [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) programming skills.

Please note that the cards in CardSimulation website are all fake. The website is built for fun.
